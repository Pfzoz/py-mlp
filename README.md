# py-mlp
A MLP implementation that utilizes very high-level concepts, such as dependency injection, encapsulation, modules, oop in general and other paradigms.

## Features
It includes the usual architecture of any Multi-Layered Perceptrons model: feed foward algorithm, back propagation joined with stochastic gradient descent. Activation and Loss Functions, and lastly, implementations of regularizing techniques to avoid the vanishing/exploding gradient problem.

### NOT-Gate

The not_example.py file contains an example of an architecture designed to be trained after a NOT Gate logic.

### Iris Dataset

The iris_example.py file contains the classical dataset utilized by many; it makes use of other usual techniques such as normalization and data encoding.
