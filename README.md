# py-mlp
A MLP implementation that utilizes very high-level concepts, such as dependency injection, encapsulation, modules, oop in general and other paradigms.

## Features
It includes the usual architecture of any Multi-Layered Perceptrons model: feed foward algorithm, back propagation joined with stochastic gradient descent. Activation and Loss Functions, and lastly, implementations of regularizing techniques to avoid the vanishing/exploding gradient problem.
